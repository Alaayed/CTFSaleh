### Preferred Stock
Present value of future cash flows, but equity securities do not mature so we use the same formula for perpetual bonds.
$$\text{preferred stock value} = \frac{\text{dividend payment per period}}{r}$$
### Common Stock
Typically doesn't payout dividends on a fixed basis, only when the company's management decides. Uses the dividends discount model.
- Assumes a constant future dividend
- Assumes some constant of growth rate for the dividend 
- Assume multistage DDM with varying growth rates followed by constant growth rate (Practically, solve for PV of the varying growth rate as straight cash flow---then find the PV of the constant growth period and apply the discount rate to it to convert to the actual present value.)
$$ V_0 = \frac{D_1}{k_e-g_c}$$
