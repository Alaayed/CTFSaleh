**Exchange Rate**: Value of one currency when exchanging from one currency to another.
$$3.75\frac{SAR}{USD}$$
Where $SAR$ is the price currency and $USD$ is the base currency.

#### Spot/Forward Exchange Rates X [[Forward Interest Rates]]

The forward spot differential must reflect the interest rate differential under no-arbitrage. 

This is because if this does not hold, there exists a risk-free arbitrage opportunity where borrowing from the lower interest rate country to invest in the higher interest rate country would result in a net profit---essentially printing money for free.

$$\frac{F}{S} = \frac{1+i_{SAR}}{1+i_{USD}}$$
$$\begin{align}
S&= \text{spot rate}\\
F&= \text{forward rate}\\
i_{?}&=\text{interest rate}
\end{align}$$
