**Definition**: The interest rate for a loan to be made at some point in the future.
**Notation**: 
$$IyJy = \text{rate for $J$ year loan $I$ years from now}$$
#### Spot Interest Rate
**Definition**: The interest rate on the spot right now. 
**Notation**: 
$$S_i = \text{rate for $i$ year rate today}$$
#### Intersection
Any spot interest rate can be constructed as any valid grouping of spot interest rate and forward interest rate as long as they cover the same time time interval:
$$(1+S_3)^3 = (1+S_1)(1+1y1y)(1+2y1y)$$
In english: The interest rate for a 3 year loan today is the same as the rate for a one year loan, then another 1 year loan, then another one year loan.
