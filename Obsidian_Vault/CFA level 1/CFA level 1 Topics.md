Discounting Cash Flows:
- The process of converting future cash flows to their value today to reflect the fact that current cash is more valuable than future cash. Bird in hand vs 10 in the forest.
	- Why is money more valuable today? Because it can be:
		- Invested
		- Avoid inflation
		- Used rn
	- Why is money less valuable tomorrow?
		- Exposed to Inflation and risk
		- Oppertunity Cost
		- Cannot be used rn
$$DCF = \sum_{i=1}^n\frac{CF_i}{(1+r)^i}$$
Where
$$
\begin{align}
DCF &= \text{Discounted Cash Flow}\\
CF  &= \text{Cash Flow}\\
r   &= \text{Interest Rate}\\
n &= \text{Final Year}
\end{align}
