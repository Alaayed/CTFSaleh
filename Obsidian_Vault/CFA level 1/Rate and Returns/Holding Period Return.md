Literally just 
$$
\begin{align}
HPR = \frac {P_f}{P_i}
\end{align}
$$
$$
\begin{align}
P_f &= \text{End of period value}\\
P_i&= \text{Start of period value}
\end{align}
$$
$$
P_f \equiv \text{income} + \text{end price} - \text{inital price}
$$
HPR range from $0<\infty$ though if it's greater than one ensure you factored initial price in $P_f$
For multiple years the HPR is (note is may also be called annualized returns):

$$
\begin {align}
	HPR =-1+ \prod_{i = 1} ^ n (1+HPR_i)
\end {align}
$$
