What is the required Rate of return? It's how much you need to pay someone in interest to get them to willingly give up their money. Also referred to as the discount rate.
Given the types of risks, this is the expected nominal rate of interest as referenced by Schweder 2025 level 1 CFA 
$$
\begin{align}
\text{nomial rate of interest} 
&= \text{risk free rate premium}\\
&+ \text{default risk premium}\\
&+ \text{inflation rate premium}\\
&+ \text{liquditiy risk premium}\\
&+ \text{maturity risk premium}\\
\end {align}
