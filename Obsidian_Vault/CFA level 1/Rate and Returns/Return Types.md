- **Gross Return**: The total return before deducting management and administration fees.
- **Net Return**: Return after management and administration fees are deducted.
- **Pretax Nominal Return**: Return before taxes. Each type of income maybe taxed at different rates
- **After-Tax Nominal Return**: Return after tax liabilities are deducted.
- **Real Return**: Nominal return after adjusting for inflation.
- **Leveraged Return**: Return after buying something with money you don't have. That's literally it. If an asset is priced at 100 and you put in 10 you just buy the asset by borrowing 90. The return is calculated as 
$$\text{leveraged return} = \frac{\Delta \text{price}}{\text{leverage investment}} {}$$
$$\text{leverage return (Schweser)} = \frac{r(V_0+V_b) - r_b(V_b)}{V_0}$$
This makes more sense when it's just about borrowing money.

$$
(\text{real return} + 1) = \frac{(1+ \text{real risk free rate}) +(1+\text{risk premium})}{(1+\text{inflation premium})}
$$
