$r = \text{annulized rate of return}$
### Zero Coupon Bonds
$$ PV = FV (1 + r)^{-N}$$
### Annual Coupon Bonds
In human, sum all the coupon payments and consider them as mini zero coupon bonds.
$$PV = \sum _ {i = 1} ^ {N-1}\frac{FV* r_c}{(1+r_y)^{i}} \;\; + FV *(1+r)^{-N} $$
### Perpetual Bonds
Bonds that payout coupons forver
$$PV = \frac{\text{payment}}{r}$$
### Amortizing bonds
Bonds that pay off the principle over the coupon payments.
$$\text{annuity payments} = \frac{r \cdot PV}{1- (1+r)^{-t}}$$
