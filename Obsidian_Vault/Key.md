A candidate key is minimal set of attributes ( X ) required to identify tuples ( Y ) in the relation.
\( X -> Y \)

***Note:***
- A **superkey** is a set of attributes that uniquely identifies a tuple.
- A **superkey** is a superset of a candidate key
- A **candidate key** is a *minimal* superkey (no extra attributes).
- If \( X \) is not a superkey, it's certainly not a candidate key either.
